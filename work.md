<h2><a href="http://tenable.com">Tenable Network Security</a></h2>
<p>This was more than a redesign. This was a complete rebranding from top to bottom. Alongside my coworker, <a href="http://jessicatabeling.com/">Jessica Tabeling</a>, we rebranded Tenable Network Security. I did the type, the site, while she came up with the colors and the logo.</p>
<p>The site is a fluid, mobile first design. I had to upgrade the old Tenable website from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7. This was my first time using Sass on a big project and I must say it helped immensely.</p>

<h2><a href="http://wfuv.org">WFUV Radio</a></h2>
<p>I worked at WFUV while I was in grad school at Fordham University. Redesigning WFUV was my first time working with Drupal as well as being my first production site using responsive web design. Thankfully, I had my coworker, <a href="http://jamesohara.net">Jim O'Hara</a> to show me the ropes when it came to Drupal.</p>
<p>Together, we drastically changed how WFUV was represented on the web. We brought audio and video content to the forefront of the site along with integrating the NPR API to pull in syndicated coverage of news and music events.</p>
