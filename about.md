<p><img src="/img/tim-and-henry.jpg" alt="Tim Teeling" class="alignleft" style="width: 40%"/> I'm Tim Teeling, an award-winning web worker living in Baltimore, MD working at <a href="https://www.tenable.com">Tenable</a>.</p>

<p>I'm obsessed with the web. I'm constantly tinkering, building, reading and learning. Currently obsessing over <a href="/service-workers">service workers</a>, maintainable design systems and security.</p>

<p>I like to teach and share with others. I've taught elementary students and <a href="http://learningthemodernweb.com">college students</a> how to code. (You'll have to ask me in person which group surprises me more).</p>

<p>When I'm away from my computer, my dog Henry keeps me busy on hiking trails around the area.</p>
