<p><img src="/img/tim-teeling.jpg" alt="Tim Teeling" class="alignleft" style="width: 40%"/>I'm Tim Teeling. I'm a web designer living in Baltimore, MD working for <a href="http://tenable.com">Tenable</a> where I deal with front end development for our main Drupal site and I dabble in product UI design as well.</p>

<p>I moonlight teaching about the web at Loyola University Maryland. You can follow my courses at <a href="http://learningthemodernweb.com">LearningtheModernWeb.com.</a></p>

<p>While I'm obsessed with the web, I also have a particular interest in photography and videography. You can find me having a hand in a bunch of things on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22tim+teeling%22&search_sort=video_view_count&search_type=videos">YouTube</a> from WFUV as well as on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22tim%20teeling%22">Flickr.</a></p>

<p>I've also had the fortune of having some of my work being picked up and published by <a href="http://www.npr.org/search/index.php?searchinput=%22tim+teeling%22&dateId=0&programId=0">NPR Music</a></p>
