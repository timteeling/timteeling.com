<p class="lede">Things have changed.</p>

My life is very different from twelve months ago. I’m a creature of habit and don’t usually react well to switching up the routine. No more. It's time for a hard refresh.


## Change at Work

For the first time, I’m at a job where I’m not planning and working on a site redesign. I was fortunate to have been able to redesign and help rebrand my company, but I’m still getting used to the life of an in-house designer post-redesign. There’s no more drastic changes, no more big launch day. It’s been incremental improvements and thoughts into how to make existing pages and ideas better.

Honestly, I’m tired of working with the same fonts, colors, and grid system, and brand every day. I need to clear my head and try something new. I need to keep learning.

### Product Design
In September, Tenable launched a new standalone product, the Passive Vulnerability Scanner. As a developer driven company, Tenable didn’t put much though into the needs for the interface. The decision was made to reskin and adapt the UI of our main product, Nessus to fit the needs of PVS.

## Bye, Bye WordPress
My new site is a nice change for me. I got rid of WordPress and am trying out Jekyll instead. My reason? I wanted to build a site without without a database and without PHP. I'm now dipping my toes into static site generation, local development, Ruby, and Liquid.

Other changes include switching from Typekit to H&FJ's [Cloud.typography](http://typography.com/cloud). Using these new webfonts from H&FJ are what spawned this redesign.
