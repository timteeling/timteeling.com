It's called the *box* model after all...

## How can we do this?
Easier said then done... 

### Pseudo elements

### Negative margins
In editorial sites as well as marketing sites, large blocks of text are inevitable. Common knowledge is to break up large blocks of text with subheadings and lists. Another method that can break up the monotony and break out of the box is a pull quote. A pull quote used along with a negative margin looks good and makes the large block of text more skimmable.

### Absolute positioning
Developers shiver using absolute positioning in responsive layouts.
