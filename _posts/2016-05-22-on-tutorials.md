We all struggle to stay on top of the latest trends. There is no shortage of quick tips, deep dives, getting started posts. Hell, there are even more options when you include videos. While we all learn differently, I've come to find that there are some universal principles all tutorials should follow.

Packages break over time. I've gone through countless Tutsplus, Treehouse and other tutorials where I get stuck halfway in due to a a breaking change in a framework and I'm not sure what version I'm supposed to be using.

Most monthly subscription services have communities and forums attached to their courses but often they are filled with unanswered questions of users who have come across issues with the material.

- Make version numbers explicit when install Packages
- Better yet -> provide a package.json file or starter files in general
- Never paste large blocks of code. Type it all out
- Leave in slip ups and debugging of errors. It shows you're human and also how to troubleshoot a problem.
- Provide source code and demos as much as possible
- Avoid saying "just" http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/
